          With over a year and a half of dedicated experience in web app
          development, I bring a wealth of expertise to the table. During a
          four-month internship at Ezline Software House, I honed my skills and
          gained valuable insights into the industry. The remainder of my
          professional journey has been marked by collaborative efforts, where I
          actively contributed to various projects, supporting and collaborating
          with seasoned senior developers. This hands-on experience has not only
          enriched my technical proficiency but also instilled a strong
          commitment to excellence in every project I undertake.
